# 🤖 AI Solution Stack with CrewAI

This repository defines a **cloud-native AI automation stack** using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/). It leverages multiple agents to handle development, testing, security auditing, and DevOps automation — fully orchestrated through GitHub Actions, with no local execution required.

---

## 🚀 Project Structure

- `crewai.yaml` – Defines CrewAI agents, tasks, memory, and LLMs.
- `pyproject.toml` – Minimal config required for CrewAI CLI.
- `.env.example` – Placeholder for API keys and service URLs.
- `.github/workflows/run-crewai.yaml` – GitHub Actions workflow to run CrewAI in the cloud.

## 🧠 Agents & Responsibilities

| Agent         | Role                | Description                                                       | Tools                       | Expected Input                                      | Output                                                  |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `DevAgent`    | Code Generator       | Writes application code based on task prompts                    | `codeium`, `gpt-4o`         | Description of the service to build                 | Python scripts, app code, logic                          |
| `TestAgent`   | Quality Assurance    | Develops tests for generated code                                | `testim`                    | Source code or spec                                 | Unit/integration test scripts                            |
| `SecAgent`    | Security Auditor     | Audits the code for vulnerabilities and recommends fixes         | `synk`                      | Application code                                    | Security report, CVE findings, suggestions               |
| `DevOpsAgent` | Infra Automation     | Builds infrastructure-as-code for deployment (K8s, Terraform)    | `KubeAI`, `TerraformAI`     | Codebase or system requirements                     | YAML manifests, `.tf` files for infrastructure setup     |

## 💾 Memory & LLMs

- **Memory:**
  - `qdrant` (vector store) — configurable via API key + URL
  - `chromadb` (optional)
- **LLMs:**
  - `openai` — uses GPT-4o via API key

---

## 🔑 Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your secrets:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
QDRANT_API_KEY=your-key-here
QDRANT_URL=https://your-qdrant-instance
CHROMADB_URL=https://your-chromadb-instance
```

Secrets must also be added to **GitHub > Repo Settings > Secrets and variables** for workflows to function.

---

## 🧪 How to Use (No Local Scripts)

1. Push any changes to `master`
2. Visit the **Actions** tab in GitHub
3. Select **“CrewAI Automation”**
4. Click **“Run workflow”**

The agents will run their tasks directly in the cloud.

---

## 🌱 Roadmap Ideas

- [ ] Slack or Discord notification integration
- [ ] Deploy CrewAI outputs with auto `kubectl` or `terraform apply`
- [ ] UI dashboard for triggering agent tasks
- [ ] Auto versioning and artifact upload

## 🧩 Workflow Structure
This project separates workflows into two categories:

**1. full-automation.yaml (Generic)**
Location: .github/workflows/full-automation.yaml

Runs when: Changes occur in crewai.yaml, src/**, or terraform/**

Purpose: Runs CrewAI to generate/update Terraform infrastructure as code.

Use case: Shared automation across all apps; no app-specific logic here.

**2. deploy-<app>.yaml (Per App)**
Location: .github/workflows/deploy-predictive-maintenance.yaml (example)

Runs when: Changes occur in app/**, terraform/**, or the workflow file itself

Purpose: Deploys a specific app (e.g., Predictive Maintenance) to Kubernetes using Terraform + Docker.

Use case: Isolated deployments with app-specific steps.


## ⚙️ full-automation.yaml (Generic CrewAI Automation)
🔁 Runs CrewAI and commits generated Terraform configs.

Triggers:

On manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

On any changes to:

crewai.yaml

src/**

terraform/**

Purpose:

Generic automation used to process file changes and generate infrastructure using CrewAI.

Does not apply infrastructure or deploy applications.

Supports multiple applications by just observing the project structure and committing .tf files.

## 🚀 deploy-predictive-maintenance.yaml (App-specific deployment)
🚢 Handles infrastructure apply and deployment for the Predictive Maintenance App.

Triggers:

On any changes to:

app/**

terraform/**

This specific workflow file

Purpose:

Applies the Terraform infrastructure from files generated by CrewAI.

Builds and deploys the Predictive Maintenance Docker app into GKE.

Ensures Kubernetes deployment happens in a clean and isolated way from the CrewAI generation step.

## ✅ Why This Structure Is Great for You

| File                                | Role           | Triggered When                          | Purpose                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `full-automation.yaml`              | Generic        | Infra logic or `crewai.yaml` changes     | Run CrewAI and commit `.tf` files       |
| `deploy-predictive-maintenance.yaml`| App-specific   | App code or K8s configs change           | Apply infra + deploy app                |
| Additional per-app workflows        | Scalable       | Add for more apps (e.g. `deploy-xyz.yaml`)| Keep deployment logic modular           |


## 🧪 How to Run
Manual CrewAI run: Go to GitHub Actions → CrewAI Full Automation → click "Run workflow"

Make infra changes: Edit crewai.yaml or src/**, commit – full-automation.yaml runs

Update/deploy app: Edit app/** or its k8s YAMLs, commit – deploy-predictive-maintenance.yaml runs


## 🛡 Disclaimer

This project is for experimentation and prototyping. Outputs from AI agents should be reviewed before use in production environments.
